# Welcome to LogoRank

**LogoRank** is a visionary startup. Our mission is to enhance language learning experiences and support learners in progressing at their own pace using innovative technology.

## The Idea Behind LogoRank

Reading materials that align with one's language proficiency is crucial in mastering a new language. However, finding texts that match a learner's level can be challenging. **LogoRank** aims to simplify this process by developing a tool that predicts the difficulty of French texts for English speakers, facilitating a more tailored learning experience.

### The Potential Impact

For learners, being presented with too-difficult texts can hinder learning, while too-easy texts may not offer enough challenges to facilitate growth. **LogoRank** addresses this by providing text recommendations that are just right for the user's current level. This approach enhances learning efficiency and boosts learner confidence and engagement.

### Our Goals

Our long-term goal is to integrate **LogoRank** into the daily learning routine of language learners worldwide, making it an indispensable tool in their language learning journey. Before testing our App, here is how we created an algorithm just for you!
